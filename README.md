# Matlab Scripts for Interfacing with ChatGPT

This repository contains a set of Matlab scripts that allow you to interface with ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. With these scripts, you can use ChatGPT to generate text, answer questions, and carry out other natural language processing tasks.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, you will need to have Matlab installed on your computer. You will also need to obtain an API key from OpenAI in order to access ChatGPT. You can obtain an API key by following the instructions on the OpenAI website.

Once you have obtained your API key, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatgpt-matlab.git

```

You can then open Matlab and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository. From there, you can run the scripts to interface with ChatGPT.
Usage

The repository contains the following scripts:

- `chatgpt_generate.m`: Generates text using ChatGPT. You can specify the prompt and the number of tokens to generate.

- `chatgpt_answer_question.m`: Answers a question using ChatGPT. You can specify the question and the context in which it should be answered.

- `chatgpt_translate.m`: Translates text from one language to another using ChatGPT. You can specify the source language, target language, and the text to be translated.

To use these scripts, simply open them in Matlab and follow the instructions in the comments. You will need to provide your API key in order to authenticate with the OpenAI API.

## Contributing
